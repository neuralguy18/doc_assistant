Document Assistant Project

Welcome to the Document Assistant project! This project will help you build a sophisticated document processing system using LangChain and LangGraph. You'll create an AI assistant that can answer questions, summarize documents, and perform calculations on financial and healthcare documents.
Project Overview

This document assistant uses a multi-agent architecture with LangGraph to handle different types of user requests:

    Q&A Agent: Answers specific questions about document content
    Summarization Agent: Creates summaries and extracts key points from documents
    Calculation Agent: Performs mathematical operations on document data
